Use the operations agent to build Approvals, Cron, Config, Skills, Devices, and Logs views. Approvals: real-time notifications, approve/reject, deny list management. Cron: job CRUD, execution history. Config: schema-driven form + raw JSON editor. Logs: live tailing with level/source filters in monospace. Create all Zustand stores. Use /design for styling. Run /dev to verify. Commit your work when done.
